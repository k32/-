* Parser
** DONE [#B] Get rid of dictiopnary concatenation
Concatenate rules instead
** DONE [#C] Add parsing of numeric costs
Not sure if really needed; we probably won't use costs for starters.

Kind of done, but we just drop the numbers.

** TODO [#B] Handle connectors in the lvals
* Generator
** TODO What data structure is needed to effectively lookup links
 - Trie?
** TODO [#A] Write a class for voretions
** TODO [#B] Add some psihoza
We should use other method to enrich the dictionary.
