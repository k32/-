#+TITLE: Zen Master

It was a small research project aimed to find out whether Link Grammar
created for natural language parsing could also be used to generate
grammatically correct random texts. E.g. a small link grammar like
below:

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
cat dog : AR- & @AD- & V+;

a : ARu+;

the : ARd+;

runs sleeps : V- & { D- };

gray lazy : AD+;

slowly soundly : D+;
#+END_SRC

generates following texts:

=A gray lazy cat runs. The dog soundly sleeps.= and so on.

The result was quite disappointing: large NLP grammars used in spell
checkers aren't suitable for the text synthesis. The result didn't
look natural or funny.
